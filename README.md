# Tailwind Config Summary

This package parses a Tailwind configuration object and outputs a summary of the classes that will be outputted by the utility.

It is currently WIP. Run `yarn test` after installing the repo to see what the output looks like.

See `current-output.json` for the latest result of the parser.
